# Revision 858 - October 20, 2015

This repo provides code-level insight into the scrapped HTML5 client, there is no server provided at this time!

## Setup

```
npm install
npm run setup
npm run build
```

This will install dependencies, deobfuscate the client bootstrap and workers, then build a new bundle.

## Credits

* Walied: General deobfuscating, getting worker scripts working with client bootstrap.
* zwyz: Writing the deobfuscator tooling.
* Pea2nuts: General deobfuscating.
